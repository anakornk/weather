## A Simple Weather App created with React

1) Uses Apixu Weather API <br>
2) Implemented my own search bar with autocomplete <br>
(click/touch to select, "tab to select" not yet implemented) <br>
3) Loading Screen <br>
4) Responsive Design <br>
5) Simple Animations <br>


## Config
Please create the file "config.js" in "src" folder that exports an API_KEY: <br>

var API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE";
exports.API_KEY = API_KEY;
